# This means that the pod will PREFER to get
# scheduled on a node that has a sku=small label.
#
# First label one/more nodes with some kind of tag
# we are classifying our nodes as small, medium &
# heavy and the label name is "sku" value can be
# "small / medium / heavy"
#
# First label nodeone.example.com as small:
#
# kubectl label nodes nodeone.example.com sku=small
#
# Confirm for the labels on nodes using:
#
# kubectl get nodes --show-labels 
#
# create namespace learning -
# kubectl create namespace learning
#
# run the pod
# kubectl create -f pod-with-preferred-node-affinity.yml
#
# check the pod
# kubectl get pods --namespace=learning --output=wide
#
# get details about pod
# kubectl describe pod/nnappone --namespace=learning
#
# check for the node where its running, it should be
# PROBABLY on nodes with label "sku=small"
# 
# delete pod
# kubectl delete pod/nnappone --namespace=learning
